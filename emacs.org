* syntax
** basic
1. (setq) (defun) are the most important and basic code!!!
2. ('symbol) used like pointer
3. backquote difference with quote:
   '(...some code...)
   when use quote:code in the bracket won't be evaluated
   '(,(...some code...))
   when use backquote:code in the ,() will be evaluated
4. don't be confused by add-to-list and some other function
   like C:
   when you need to change the origin value of a variable
   you must use the pointer
   in lisp: you must use quote
5. (mapcar func list)
